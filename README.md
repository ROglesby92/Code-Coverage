# Code-Coverage
Some work i did that involved evaluating "coverage" logs. Evaluating large sets of data and recording hit's or misses.

"Small_Dump_File" is a short version of some data i would be evaluating.

CodeCoverage.py 
- Implemented functions to evaluate total amount of complete hits, partial hits and misses of the test data.
- Various functions such as "verbose" to show more individual node data, and options to forward the data into CSV files for later evaluation.
